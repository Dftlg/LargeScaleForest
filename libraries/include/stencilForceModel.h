/*
  To simulate a deformable object, we usually discretize it into elements.
  For example, a 3D solid can be represented by a set of tetrahedra,
  and a cloth can be represented by a set of triangles. When we simulate 
  an object, we need to evaluate the elastic energy, internal forces
  and sometimes the tangent stiffness matrix. These quantities are usually
  evaluated by computing them for each individual element
  and then assembled into a single global per-object vector.
  For example, when we compute the elastic energy of a tetrahedral mesh,
  we can compute the energy of each tetrahedron first and then add them together.
  In summary, the entire evaluation process can be considered as
  an assembling of quantities at the individual units. We call the units "stencils".
  In cloth simulation, a stencil is a single triangle for in-plane stretch and shear.
  Another stencil type is an edge between two triangles to model the bending energy.
  In FEM solid simulation, each element can be treated as a stencil.
  In mass-spring systems, each spring can be treated as a stencil.
  In this file, we define a class called StencilForceModel that provides an 
  abstract interface to stencils.
